<!-- 
    This was an example of the NUI system on a plugin.
    â›” You might wanna see the 'dumping.html' file to learn how the files built.
    ---

    Notes:

    1. The NUI would automatically used if the plugin folder contains 'nui' folder.
    2. NUI starting point is 'index.html', so make sure have the main file with the name of 'index.html'.
    3. You don't need to use <html>, <head> or <body> tag, just put all the content inside it.
    4. If you wanted to use <head> or <body> tag, that's okay, but at the end it would not be rendered, only the content inside it that would be rendered.
    5. Jquery is set Globally, you could use Jquery on here without need to importing it.
    6. If you're referencing a files make sure to use ./ at the links in the front.

    Conclusion:

    What actually happens on here is that all nui files would be merged as 1 things

    Let's learn and see more example below
 -->

<html>
    <head>
        <!-- (OPTIONAL) Use this meta to adjust the index of the NUI between other plugin NUI, if this one is not available, the default value would be 1 -->
        <meta name="nuiIndex" content="1" />

        <!-- 
            1. Stylesheet MUST be imported / MUST be an external stylesheet, this stylesheet would ONLY APPLY ON THIS PLUGIN 
            2. You MUST use ./ in the links in the front
        -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />

        <!-- If you are using css inside this HTML, then the css would apply GLOBALLY, be careful -->
        <style>
            .someGlobalClass {
                opacity: 0;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- 
            This id will be parsed with the name of the plugins, if you're using a query selector on Javascript or JQUERY, that would be parsed too.
        -->
        <div class="container" id="someDiv"></div>

        <!-- 
            1. Javascript Files MUST be imported / MUST be an external JS file, Check the example JS file for more references. 
            2. You MUST use ./ in the links in the front
        -->
        <script src="./script.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
